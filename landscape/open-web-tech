# Open Web Technologies

With tools like Rust, WebAssembly, and AV1, Mozilla aims to support developers in making open web technologies to keep the internet healthy by using Mozilla products. By giving developers privacy preserving tools, we can help reduce security risks and expand our total addressable market of the web. 

A representative example of discovering what developers want is to explore why 54% of surveyed developers want to use WebAssembly when at present, only 3% of those surveyed have actually used it. By proactively engaging with video codecs, a positive impact can be made today, but a much greater impact can be made as the volume of video consumed online grows (currently 1 billion hours of video watched on youtube a day) and as video get larger (e.g., 4K and HDR). By retaining the talent who have created on the web and by enabling technologies that empower a new wave of developers, Mozilla can expand its total addressable market of the web, longstanding markets can be disrupted, and creators can be rewarded for their creations. 

Through various touchpoints including Rust, WebAssembly, and AV1, Mozilla is attempting to broaden the reach of web development by targeting new form factors to enable new capabilities and to prevent single-vendor controlled toolchains and royalty-bearing technology from becoming dominant. 

It is the hope that Rust will continue to be adopted and it will continue to rise on the list of prefered programming languages (Currently 15th). It will be considered the choice of new Mozilla projects where performance or security is vital. Mozilla foresees the continuing trend of multiple major tech companies adopting Rust at the heart of major projects. Additional goals for Rust include: scaling the language to handle larger code bases, scaling educational materials for intermediate and advanced users, and to scale tolling support to larger teams and projects. 

Mozilla is working to build the web’s fastest WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime in Firefox while also advancing Wasm as a standard. It is also imperative for Mozilla to bring Wasm to new environments outside the browser, while also bringing it to all existing browsers through Cranelift compiler. This has a potential impact on Mozilla’s adjacent explorations, more notably, affecting performance in mixed reality and for small, imbedable solutions for IoT. 

Mozilla serves as a founding member of the Alliance for Open Media who recognizes that video forecasts to account for 82 percent of all internet use by 2021. To ensure the pledge to develop the best video technology that is royalty-free, AOMedia has made AV1 publically available. The primary focus for Mozilla is to drive AV1 adoption. This will manifest through better and faster encoders that will result in less bandwidth and an increase in use cases, which include real-time encoding with Twitch, WebRTC, and VR. Currently, one billion hours (114,115 years) of video is watched on Youtube per day. Sixty percent of this is on mobile. This only accounts for 17% of video internet traffic. AV1 became supported in all web browsers in 2018. AV1 adoption will not come to connected devices till after 2020 and mass adoption would not happen until 2020-2022. By building faster decoders, AV1 can be used on more devices. Mozilla first aims to ensure that Firefox has the best AV1 playback experience.

Support developers and creators with efficient tools that ensure speed and safety and royalty-free technology. Increase accessibility with cross-platform enablement. Address the potential threats to current web tech while also expanding this scope to nascent web technologies and platforms and enabling other research domains within Mozilla.

## Research Questions
1. What is the 3D Web? What does it look like?
2. What does a possible future look like in which screens virtually disappear?
3. What will it take for us to get to "normal" mixed reality experiences, in which the average consumer might participate?
